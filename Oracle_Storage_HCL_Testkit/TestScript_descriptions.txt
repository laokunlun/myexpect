A brief description of what each file is used for.

runCertificationTests (python):
  The automated portion of the certification process is performed 
  by the runCertificationTests script.  The testkit is interactive. 
  The user will be prompted to execute manual operations such as 
  mapping, unmapping, and resizing LUNs, in between test cases.  


Generic Plugin tests for Fibre Channel:
Test_Suite_1-FibreChannel_Setup (tcl/expect):
  Sets up the environment for testing.  Discovers OVS servers, 
  configures VM and Storage networks, and creates vNICs for VMs
  that will be created by subsequent tests.
  (Test Case: GSFC-101)

Test_Suite_1-FibreChannel_Map1 (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the mapping of LUNs to each of the OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSFC-102)

Test_Suite_1-FibreChannel_Resize (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the resizing of LUNs is visible on each of the OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSFC-103)

Test_Suite_1-FibreChannel_Unmap (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the Unmapping of LUNs from each of the OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSFC-104)

Test_Suite_1-FibreChannel_Map2 (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the mapping of LUNs to both OVS servers 
  (Test Case: GSFC-105)

Test_Suite_1-FibreChannel_Map3 (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the unmapping of LUNs from both OVS servers, and the
  resizing of LUNs which are mapped to both OVS servers.
  (Test Case: GSFC-106)

Test_Suite_1-FibreChannel_Repo (tcl/expect):
  Creates a clustered server pool and repository, downloads assemblies,
  templates and ISO images for VM creation, and creates VMs.
  (Test Cases: GSFC-107 and GSFC-108)

  ** Please see TestCase_descriptions for further details 
     about specific test cases.



Generic Plugin tests for iSCSI:
Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_CHAP_setup (tcl/expect):
  Configure the test environment for iSCSI tests using CHAP Authentication,
  if supported.  Discover OVS servers, configure VM and Storage networks,
  configure SAN Server, and create vnics.
  (Test Case: GSIS-101)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_CHAP_Map1 (tcl/expect):
  Verify LUNs have been mapped to both OVS servers.
  (Test Case: GSIS-201)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_CHAP_Resize (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the resizing of LUNs is visible on OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSIS-202)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_CHAP_Unmap (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the unmapping of LUNs is visible on OVS servers, then
  delete the SAN Server.
  (Test Case: GSIS-203 and GSIS-204)

  ** CHAP Authentication tests are only run if the user specifies
     that this is a supported feature of the storage array.

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_Setup (tcl/expect):
  Configure the test environment for iSCSI tests with CHAP Authentication disabled,
  if supported.  Discover OVS servers, configure VM and Storage networks,
  configure SAN Server, and create vnics.
  (Test Case: GSIS-101)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_Map1 (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the mapping of LUNs to each of the OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSIS-301)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_Resize (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the resizing of LUNs is visible on each of the OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSIS-302)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_Unmap (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the unmapping of LUNs is visible on each of the OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSIS-303)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_Map2 (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the mapping of LUNs to both OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSIS-304)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_Map3 (tcl/expect):
  Verifies the resizing and unmapping of LUNs to both OVS servers
  (Test Case: GSIS-305)

Test_Suite_1-iSCSI_Repo (tcl/expect):
  Creates a clustered server pool and repository, downloads assemblies,
  templates and ISO images for VM creation, and creates VMs.
  (Test Cases: GSIS-306 and GSIS-307)

  ** Please see TestCase_descriptions for further details 
     about specific test cases.




Vendor Plugin tests for Fibre Channel:
Test_Suite_2-FibreChannel_AGandVM (tcl/expect):
  Configure the environment for the tests, discover OVS servers, create
  VM and Storage networks, create vNICs, create Access Groups on the 
  Storage Array, create LUNs on the Storage Array, map and unmap LUNs,
  resize LUNs, create server pools and repositories, create VMs, 
  migrate VMs, and clone VMs.
  (Test Cases: VSFC-101 - 108, VSFC-201 - 208)

Test_Suite_2-FibreChannel_Cleanup (tcl/expect):
  Verify that LUNs and Access Groups can be deleted.

  ** Please see TestCase_descriptions for further details 
     about specific test cases.




Vendor Plugin tests for iSCSI:
Test_Suite_2-iSCSI_AGandVM (tcl/expect):
  Configure the environment for the tests, discover OVS servers, create
  VM and Storage networks, create vNICs, create Access Groups on the 
  Storage Array, create LUNs on the Storage Array, map and unmap LUNs,
  resize LUNs, create VMs, migrate VMs, and clone VMs.
  (Test Cases: VSIS-101 - 108, VSIS-201 - 208)

Test_Suite_2-iSCSI_Cleanup (tcl/expect):
  Verify that LUNs and Access Groups can be deleted.

  ** Please see TestCase_descriptions for further details 
     about specific test cases.



Generic Plugin tests for NFS:
Test_Suite_3-NFS (tcl/expect):
  Test suite 3 is comprised of the test cases for the Oracle Generic
  NFS Plugins.  Details about specific test cases can been seen in 
  the TestCase_descriptions.txt file.



TearDown_test_environment (tcl/expect):
  Cleanup of the test environment is attempted with this script.  Only
  those items created by the scripts are removed and deleted.

GetLogs (tcl/expect):
  Copy AdminServer and CLI logs from the OVM Manager node, or copy
  ovs-agent logs from OVM Server nodes.  The script also attempts
  to login to each of the OVM Server nodes to run sosreport, then
  copy the resulting tarball back to the main log directory for
  inclusion in the overall test results package.

commonExpectDef.cli (tcl/expect):
  The library file for all of the expect scripts.

hclhelper.py (python):
  The library file for the wrapper

__init__.py
  python package

ovm-hcl-config.sample
  A sample configuration file, to illustrate the expected values for
  the config file.
